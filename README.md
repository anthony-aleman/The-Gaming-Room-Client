# The-Gaming-Room-Client

The Gaming Room is a client that requested CTS to design a game that can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. They required the game to have multiplayer capabilities and be scalable to handle a large number of players.

In developing the documentation, I made sure to consider the client's specific needs and requirements, as well as the unique features and limitations of each operating system. I also provided clear explanations and diagrams to help the client understand the proposed architecture.

Developing the design document helped me to think through the various components and interactions of the system before starting to write code. This allowed me to identify potential issues and plan for scalability, security, and maintainability.

If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would focus on providing even more detail and clarity in the diagrams and explanations. I would also consider including more examples and scenarios to help the client visualize how the system would work in practice.

To interpret the user's needs and implement them into the software design, I used a combination of interviews with the client and end-users, as well as user research and analysis of similar games in the market. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because ultimately, the success of the software depends on whether it meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.

In approaching the software design, I utilized techniques such as use case analysis, and component-based design. In the future, I would also consider incorporating more agile methodologies, such as iterative development and continuous user feedback, to ensure the software design remains flexible and adaptable to changing needs.
